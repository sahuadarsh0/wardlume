//  ReactionPack.swift
//  Wardlume
//
//  Phase 2.5b: Pack definitions extracted from ReactionManager.
//  Phase 3a:   Added imageURL/audioURL instance properties (Option A);
//              all → computed var combining builtIn + user packs;
//              static URL helpers deleted (2 call sites updated in their files).
//
//  ── Built-in pack asset convention ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
//  Built-in image/audio URLs are resolved from Bundle.main once at static
//  initialisation time, stored on the instance, and remain nil until the
//  asset files are dropped into the Xcode blue folder reference at:
//    Bundle.main / Reactions / Packs / <pack.id> / image.png
//    Bundle.main / Reactions / Packs / <pack.id> / audio.mp3
//
//  User pack URLs are resolved from the filesystem at load time and stored
//  directly on the ReactionPack instance — no Bundle.main lookup.
//
//  Phase 4d: User pack folder loading removed. User customization is via
//  UserAssetManager slots (Phase 4a/4b/4c), not custom pack folders.
//
//  ── Adding a built-in pack ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//    1. Add a static instance in extension ReactionPack (Built-in packs) below.
//    2. Append it to `builtIn`.
//    3. For .image packs: drop image.png (and optionally audio.mp3) into
//       Wardlume/Reactions/Packs/<yourPackID>/ in Finder. No Xcode changes
//       needed — the folder is a blue folder reference.
//
//  ── Adding a user pack ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//    Phase 4d: User pack folder loading removed. User customization is via
//    UserAssetManager slots (drag-drop base/reaction images + audio in Preferences).
